# Analyzing-Coffee-Sales-using-Power-BI

This analysis was done with the help of the book " Your Essential guide to power BI " by Wyn Hopkins.

He taught some important concepts on how to use different functionalities in Power BI such as Power Query , DAX , Data Models, Power Canvas to make an interesing analysis report. 

Key Business Questions which I was able to answer using this report is - 

1) Which brand and strength of coffee had the most and least sales in years 2019,2020,2021 ?
2) Which state is the argest consumer of coffee ?
3) Who are the top customers of these products ?
