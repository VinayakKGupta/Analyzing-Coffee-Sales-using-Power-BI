# Analyzing-Coffee-Sales-using-Power-BI

This analysis was done with the help of the book " Your Essential guide to power BI " by Wyn Hopkins.

He taught some important concepts on how to use different functionalities in Power BI such as Power Query , DAX , Data Models, Power Canvas to make an interesing analysis report. 

Key Business Questions which I was able to answer using this report is - 

1) Which city consistently delivered the highest sales quantity across months, and how does it compare to the lowest-performing city?

2) Which customer groups met or missed their budget targets, and by how much?

3) What is the sales contribution of top coffee products or strengths, and how much larger is Medium strength demand compared to Strong or Decaf?
