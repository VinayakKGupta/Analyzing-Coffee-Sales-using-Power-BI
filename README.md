# Analyzing-Coffee-Sales-using-Power-BI

This analysis was done with the help of the book " Your Essential guide to power BI " by Wyn Hopkins.

He taught some important concepts on how to use different functionalities in Power BI such as Power Query , DAX , Data Models, Power Canvas to make an interesing analysis report. 

Key Business Questions which I was able to answer using this report is - 

1) Which city consistently delivered the highest sales quantity across months, and how does it compare to the lowest-performing city?

From the visual, it is clear that Perth consistently records the highest sales quantity across all cities in Australia, with 1,451 units sold in 2020, while Darwin remains the lowest with only 88 units. This pattern is not limited to 2020; when filtering the report for 2019 and 2021, the same trend continues, highlighting Perth as the strongest market and Darwin as the weakest across multiple years.

2) Which customer groups met or missed their budget targets, and by how much?

From the customer group sales vs budget analysis, we can see that in 2020, Restaurants exceeded their target, achieving 127% of budget ($4,624 vs $3,630). However, all other groups underperformed, with Independent Cafés reaching 91%, Bookstores 89%, Gift Shops 84%, and Café Franchises only 83% of their budget. A similar pattern is visible in 2021, where most groups continued to miss their targets, showing actual sales between 82–89% of budget. This highlights that Restaurants consistently outperformed expectations, while Café Franchises and Gift Shops fell behind their planned targets.

However in 2021 , none of the customer groups were able to meet their budget targets, with overall sales reaching $88,759 against a budget of $100,240 (89%). Among the groups, Independent Cafés performed best at 88% of budget ($19,114 vs $21,830), closely followed by Restaurants at 89% ($13,716 vs $15,370). On the lower end, Bookstores achieved only 82% ($12,313 vs $15,000) and Café Franchises 85% ($37,520 vs $44,230), indicating consistent underperformance in these segments.

3) What is the sales contribution of top coffee products or strengths, and how much larger is Medium strength demand compared to Strong or Decaf?

The total quantity ordered across all coffee strengths is 12,474 units. Breaking this down by strength:

Medium: 5,526 units (~44% of total)

Strong: 4,297 units (~34% of total)

Decaf: 2,651 units (~21% of total)

Insights:

Medium strength coffee clearly leads in demand, contributing the largest share of sales.

Compared to Strong, Medium demand is 1,229 units higher, which is approximately 29% more.

Compared to Decaf, Medium demand is 2,875 units higher, roughly 108% more, more than double.

Additional observations from top segments:

The Centre Across brand dominates, especially among Café Franchise customers.

Sydney is the highest consumer city for Medium strength coffee, with 657 units ordered.
